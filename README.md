## Data Visualization

In this repository, I will put all the codes I coded when I was studying about Data Visualization.  

The main programing language I used or will be using is Python. Regarding the version, when I first start with this repository I was using `Python 3.10.5`. This version might get updated in later times since I love to use updated features.  

Talking about the packages I use, I will keep on updating the `requirements.txt` file every time but it doesn't mean that you need all the packages for one `Jupyter Notebook` to work. I will try put informations about the packages I used in each `Notebooks`. Although, The main packages I will use are `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.   

To install a package run `pip install <package_name>` in your terminal. If you wanted to install multiple packages run `pip install <package_name_1> <package_name_2> <package_name_3> ...`. Finally, if you wanted to install it from the requirements file run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal but be sure to properly locate your `requirements.txt` file.
